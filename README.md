# Project3
Added the data files from the data source
Also included a .gitignore file to avoid changes to the original data even after joining and opening it using different libraries such as pandas.

WATER WELLS IN TANZANIA.
 Overview and Problem Understanding.
    After careful evaluation , it has been noted that most wells in tanzania have been experiencing trouble and are faulty. 
    A team of 5 was given data and told to help Navesco Company (a water company in Tanzania) to come up with eloquent data and machine understanding to come up 
    with different ways in which new and improved wells would help Tanzanians stop experiencing dcrought yet water is sufficient in the country

    We were able to get data from a reliable source and it will inturn be of help to us coming up with different models with different results to help in the aid of this project.
    Objectives of this project include the following :
        1. Build a classifier to predict the condition of a water well and pitch to an NGO focused on locating wells needing repair.
        2. Classify different funding potentials for new schemes and projects in Tanzania.
        3. Help and Educate communities on the importance of comunity involvement in different projects.
        4. Promote Equitable Distribution of water resources in the country.

DATA UNDERSTANDING
The data provided was divided into three different stages and levels which include the following :
    1. Testing data values
    2. Training data values
    3. Testing labels to aid in model creation.

We are required to join the data or use the data just as it is to come up with two or more different models and explanations for the problem .

 DATA EXPLORATION
 We were able to open the data and come up with different observations , for starters ,  the dataset had many unrequired columns but with no duplicates present. After that , we found out that most columns with null values were required for us to come up with clear observations for this project.

 DATA PROCESSING
 We filled different null values with specific values to avoid any errors upcoming especially with the datatypes that are of need to our modelling and machine learning.

 EDA ANALYSIS
 In this section , we were able to come up with different analysis factors that would help us in creating a model for the data provided .In turn helping us create and comme up with objectives to pitch to the stakeholders.
